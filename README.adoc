= Test case for isomorphic-git #654

This repository has been set up to demonstrate an intermittent hang in isomorphic-git (issue #654).

To run it, first install the dependencies:

 $ npm i

Then, continue running the [.path]_index.js_ script until you get it to hang.

 $ node index.js

Unfortunately, since this is an intermittent bug, it requires running the script several times to see it happen.
